				<h2>more stories about miami:</h2>
				<p id="only"> miami is the only major U.S. <br/>city founded by a woman: Julia Tuttle.<br/> In the 1890s, she owned land along the Miami River and convinced railroad tycoon Henry Flagler to extend his railroad south.<br/> Thanks to her persistence,
				Miami was incorporated in 1896 — and it grew from a mosquito-infested swamp into a major city<p/>
				<p>After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled to Miami.<br/>
				They settled mainly in what became Little Havana, bringing with them Cuban culture, politics, coffee, and music.<br/>
				Today, it remains a vibrant hub where Spanish is often heard more than English, and the smell of hand-rolled cigars fills the air.</p>
